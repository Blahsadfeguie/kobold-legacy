# kobold-legacy
A discord bot game where players play the role of kobolds surviving in a harsh, low-tech environment.

The game is discontinued by the original developer, but the source is open. Anyone is free to copy, modify, and run their own versions of this bot.

Requires a .env file in the same directory as the source file containing a bot auth token (DISCORD_TOKEN) and guild name (DISCORD_GUILD).

From the original blurb:
Kobold Legacy is a cooperative RPG where players take on the role of primitive, expendible kobolds in a high-fantasy world full of monsters and magic. Similar to Mush: Respored, the game is run by a discord bot and played by submitting commands. Inspired by games such as Die2Nite, Rimworld, and of course Dungeons and Dragons, the game tasks players to band together and survive a hostile and unforgiving world where just about every living thing wants them dead.

Gather resources, recruit friends, and discover new technologies to build your tribe's influence, while fending off hordes of goblins and other creatures. The world is persistent, so even if your tribe faces extinction, a future generation may be able to salvage the remains and get a head start on the next one. You can play a small but important role in a larger story, or succeed where your ancestors failed and become a legend. How will you build your legacy?
